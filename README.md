# Horiseon Webpage Code Refactor

## Description

The primary goal for this project was to provide an updated codebase that follows accessibility standards. This was achieved by replacing generic div elements with section specific semantic HTML elements and the addition of alt text on images. This project was also my first opportunity to inspect and improve existing code. I checked the functionality of the website and fixed links that didn't work and corrected syntax errors that were prohibiting elements from being executed correctly. I also chose to add class tags to elements that may be used and require different styling in the future. I add comments to the code describing each section of the website and the organization of styling elements so that the code can be easily navigated in the future. This project helped me understand CSS specificity and inheritance.
